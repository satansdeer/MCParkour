# Purpose: When a objective is removed, all of its data is wiped clean. Since we use the scoreboard
#	primarily for storing data, this is an efficient way to hard reset the project to "factory
#   state". If this project were to ever need some kind of persistent data between sessions, another
#   solution should be designed.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CONST (constant) scoreboard stores values which should not be changed or altered in any way.
#   They are almost always numbers which are used in math operations.
